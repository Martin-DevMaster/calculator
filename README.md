# calculator

Hey guys, so this is project for The Odin Project - calculator, and it's the last project before I move on path that I have to
choose.

So when I started with making calculator or should I say plan on how to make it, I tried to break big problems into small problems
and solve them one by one. What I had in mind when I was planning the calculator or structure of the code and how it turned out is
a little bit different, mostly because of constantly running into bugs that I had to fix and more and more code added up. I will
come back in future and try to restructure the code and make it more simple because now at the end of the project I know I could've
done some things differently at the start of the project and how to approach structuring the code and logic behind it. I learned a lot
from doing this calculator and I'm a lot more confident in javascript then when I started making the calculator.

The project code and styling was all done by me with no copying or stealing other people designs and codes, the only one I can give
credit where credit is due is The Odin Project. I learned so much more from it than any other bootcamp.
